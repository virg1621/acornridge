	<h2>Chapter 1</h2><br>

	<p>If you had told Janna Cochran that she was going to die soon, she would not have 
	believed you.  She would not have trusted your word over the word of the handsome 
	young man who escorted her to a lonely, secluded place in the woods behind the frat 
	house.</p><br>  
	
	<p>The only thing she was thinking about that night was how stupid she was and how 
	useless her life had been.  She was angry and hurt and wanted out.  She hated that 
	she had been kicked out of school because of her failing grades.  “F” for failure.  
	“F” for freak.  “F” for finished.  That’s all the school had wanted to tell her.  
	She was a big, fat, hopeless girl.</p>  <br>  
	
	<p>It wasn’t that she was drunk.  She didn’t really drink at the party.  She was too 
	depressed to drink.  Instead, she wanted to flirt.  She flirted with every boy there.  
	She was surprised when one of them took notice of her.  He was too good looking to be a 
	bad guy.  He was suave and sexy.  He seemed like the picture of perfection.  He 
	had everything together.  He talked about rugby and tennis and about his new car
	 and about how he was going to go work after school and make millions of dollars.  
	 Janna was too enthralled with this new boy to see any warning signs.</p><br>  
	 
	<p>Even in the woods, with him leading her through the trees, farther and farther 
	away from the party, she thought that he only wanted to make love to her.  She didn’t 
	think to tell anyone where she was going.  There was no need.  He was handsome and 
	brave and everything she needed to make her feel secure.</p><br>  
	
	<p>It wasn’t until the sex turned violent and he started to rape her that Janna 
	realized she was in trouble.  She fought back against his massive hands, clawing and 
	scratching as he tightened his hold on her throat.  But her strength only lasted a 
	few minutes.  Then the world turned dark, and she lost consciousness. </p><br>  
	 
	<p>He held the grip on her windpipe until the last movement died down, then dusted 
	himself off and stood over her body.  He chuckled, the sound guttural and unnatural 
	against the stillness of the trees. </p><br>  
	
	<p>Janna Cochran was dead.</p><br>  
	
	<p>This suave, debonair, playboy of a man had murdered her. </p><br>  
	 
	<p>What he was not aware of, however, was the way her soul stripped away from her 
	body like the peel from a ripe orange.  He did not see her stretch out of her corpse 
	in the same way a cat would awake from a nap and lengthen its limbs for the first time.  
	He did not know that this beautiful creature whose life he had just taken was not 
	gone, but simply transformed.  </p><br>  

	<p>Janna watched as he hoisted her lifeless body over his shoulder, carrying it 
	out of the woods.  He shivered involuntarily when she touched his shoulder with 
	her disembodied hand, then he spat and kept walking.</p><br>  

	<p>The murderer left Janna Cochran in the woods, alone and cold.  Her spirit lingered,
	 unsure of what to do, wondering how this could have happened so quickly, and 
	 confused that the light she had heard about while she was alive did not come 
	 to take her up to heaven.</p><br>
