	<p>My name is Sandra Traweek.  I'm a retired rancher from Texas. Before writing, I 
	was all sorts of things: a social worker, a reporter, and a mom.  I have two 
	daughters, a dog, and lots of other animals.  I've always wanted to write a novel, 
	so one day, I sat down and did it.  Thanks for visiting my page.  Be sure to "like" 
	Acorn Ridge on Facebook! I hope to see you again soon!
	you again soon!</p>

	<h3>How did you think of the idea for the series?</h3>
	<p>I thought about what my friends and I like to do, and I wrote a book about it.  
	I wanted to channel our insecurities, but also the amazing love that binds us.  
	It was an exercise in daydreaming about what life could be, if we are able to open 
	our minds to all of the possibilies.</p><br>
	
	<h3>How long does it take you to finish a manuscript?</h3>
	<p>It depends.  Some manuscripts come to me, and I can spit them out in a matter of 
	weeks.  With other manuscripts, it's a little harder.  Sometimes I'll rewrite it two 
	or three times before I get it right.</p><br>
	
	<h3>What is the hardest part about writing?</h3>
	<p>There are many hard things and some that are a little easier.  The hardest part, 
	in my opinion, is not getting bogged down in details.  I tend to try to write in all
	 sorts of extra information so that the reader knows what is happening, but that is 
	 not necessary, and it makes for slow reading.  My biggest challenge is cutting 
	 parts that are high on details but low on action.</p><br>
	
	<h3>Did you ever have a cat named "Pantsy"?</h3>
	<p>No.  That's just a name that I made up.  When my second daughter was very
	 little, she had a cat named "BlueBell" after the ice cream company here in Texas. 
	  BlueBell was the perfect cat for a precocious little girl!  He put up with all of
	   her antics, and the two became best friends.  So, in some ways, I'm channeling 
	   BlueBell in my writing.</p><br>
	
	<h3>Do you really have a daughter that wants to put you in a home?</h3>
	<p>No!  Not at all!  I have two very different daughters that have their own 
	personalities and quirks.  They are complete opposites, but are both wonderful 
	women.  Adele's daughter bears absolutely no resemblance to them at all.</p><br>
	
	<h3>What do you do when you're not writing?</h3>
	<p>I always write early, early in the morning, since that is the time that I'm 
	most active.  I have my computer next to me in the living room, so any time that
	 I want to write, I can pop over there and do it.  When I'm not writing, I am feeding
	  animals (my friends think I might have a few too many horses!), taking care of the 
	  ranch, and meeting my friends for lunch.  I love watching Wheel of Fortune.  And
	   occasionally, I will make a road trip to visit my daughters.</p><br>
	
	<h3>Do you believe in God?  Are you a Christian?</h3>
	<p>I believe in God, but I would not consider myself a practicing Christian.  I have
	 never really fit in at church.  I think that there is a spiritual world that we all 
	 participate in, whether we know it or not.  I think that after death, we all join 
	 a universal "spirit" of sorts.  Death is only the beginning of our journey.</p>
